        <div class="notesContainer">
            <h2> Lesson 1:Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Console: Messanger center</p>
            <br>
            <p>Open Source: Open with community input and support</p>
            <br>
            <p>Playground: A place to experiment with code</p>
            <br>
            <p>Result Sidebar: Information about each line of code</p>
            <br>
            <p> Swift's goal is to be safe,fast,and Expressive.</p>
            <br>
            <p> To be considered safe, it must be type safety, type inference, Error handling , and optionals.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Lesson 2:Constants, Variables, and Data Types</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Constant is a value that never change.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Variable is a value that can change. </p>
            <br>
            <p>To say variable is var and constant is const </p>
            <br>
            <p>Variable can be changed by only mentioning the variable. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Integer is a whole number while double is decimal</p>
            <br>
            <h2> Lesson 3: operator</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Boolean value can only have true or false</p>
            <br>
            <p>Can change integer to Double by adding (:Double)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another way to change integer to variable is having Double and then put columns. Between, put any value.</p>
            <br>
            <h2> Lesson 4: Control Flow</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Logical operators are symbols to describe something</p>
            <br>
            <p>We implement it in the if statement. If statement is when this happens, do this.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/if.png">
            <br>
            <p>There's else which means if the if-statement is wrong, do this.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/ifElse.png">
            <br>
            <p>Switch operator is similar but is layed in different ways. Case is if and default is else.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/switchStatement.png">
            <br>
            <p>Ternary Operator is putting in a two ratio to find if it's true or false.</p>
