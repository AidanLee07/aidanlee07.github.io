        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <h2>Crash Course #1</h2>
        <p>Computer is lifeload of today's life.They took care of functions that takes long time or is hard to do.<br>If it shuts down,the whole world is going to be in chaos.Now,we live in an age called Electronic Age.<br>So to the history of the computer, it
            started in 2500BCE which Mesopotamia made Abacus.It's like a hand calculator and saves data.<br>It can be hard to use since it can go up to thousands.After 4000 years, device called astrolobe which enable ships to find the latitude of the ship.Later, clocks are made for many purposes<br>
            The first computer isn't a device at all. It was a job! Their job is to calculate and store data without any machine.<br>At late 1800, computer is now started to be called machines.The first device was called Step Reckoner which can do all four operation together.It was really successful
            that it was used for three centuries. Later in World War 2,made a ranged table.<br>You used the cannon nad write all the record in a paper and use it.<br> The problem was that if they changed the cannon or the bullet,they need to change everything. Later Babbage tried to make world's most advance computer,Differnce Engine that ca n do polynomial.<br>
            Unfortunately,his project was abandoned until in 1991 a group of scientist made it and it was successful.<br>Babbage also thought of Analytical Engine which is basically a computer.He is now called father of computers.<br>Later Aba became the first programmer and Herman Hollerith made a punch card machine.<br>
            It was so successful that they later made a company called IBM. </p>
